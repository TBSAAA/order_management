# Order Management System
test website: www.haoranhuang.me

This project is a Django based order management system. It's designed to help businesses manage their order process effectively.

The front-end of the website is built with Bootstrap and JS, and the database is powered by MySQL. Redis is used for caching to ensure fast performance.

The website is currently under development and I will be adding more features and functionalities in the future.

I aim to experiment with new technologies in this project, and try to incorporate them where applicable. Some of these technologies may not be relevant to this project, but I'm using it as a learning experience.
